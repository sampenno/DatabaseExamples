# SQL lesson01

**Objective**: Create and populate an sqlite3 database with data from the Access DB Volcanoes database.

>[!NOTE]
> The queries here will only work on a MacBook, Codespaces on GitHub, Linux, FreeBSD. DO NOT attempt it on PowerShell. It makes use of the redirect symbol `<` which is standard on the shells in MacBook, Linux, FreeBSD, but is yet to be implemented on Windows PowerShell.

There are three scripts: `import_data.py`, `CreateTable.sql` and `SelectAll.sql`. The first script is in Python and allows you to import a txt file in comma delimited format (a CSV file). The second two scripts are SQL scripts. First one creates a table with the same or similar settings to the famous Volcanoes database. The second script allows you to see what is in the database.

You should ensure you study the scripts. This lesson is just to get you started. 

# STEPS
1. **Change directory to Lesson01.**
2. **Create an sqlite3 database:** `touch Volcanoes.db`
   
   This will create a zero byte file. Next you create the table(s) in the database.
4. **Create the tables by running the SQL file** `CreateTable.sql`:
   
	`sqlite3 Volcanoes.db < CreateTable.sql`

   This will create the table(s) with the settings you specify. Next you add data.
5. **Check the export file and ensure it is comma delimited.** Should look like this:
	``` 
	1,"Pelee","Violent","Martinique",0,"1932",
	2,"Mauna Loa","Quiet","Hawaii",10,"1984",
	3,"Tarawera","Violent","New Zealand",0,"1886",
 	```
6. **Run** `import_data.py`:

   `python import_data.py`
7. **Run** `SelectAll.sql`:
   
	`sqlite3 Volcanoes.db < SelectAll.sql`

Now you have a populated table in your database.

>[!NOTE]
> You can merge steps 1 and 2 and just run
> `sqlite3 Volcanoes.db < CreateTable.sql`.

> This is good to do when you first start.

# Try these queries:
1. `SELECT type FROM volcanoes_tbl;`

2. `SELECT Name,type FROM volcanoes_tbl;`

3. `SELECT name, last_erupted FROM volcanoes_tbl WHERE last_erupted = 2018;`

4. `SELECT name, type FROM volcanoes_tbl WHERE type = 'Violent';`

5. `SELECT name, type FROM volcanoes_tbl WHERE type = 'Violent' AND last_erupted = 2018;`

6. `SELECT name, type FROM volcanoes_tbl WHERE type = 'Quiet' AND location = 'New Zealand';`

## Running SQL queries in an alternate way

For each of the above, add in the prefix `volcanoes_tbl.<columnname>`. For example, the questions above would be:

1. `SELECT volcanoes_tbl.type FROM volcanoes_tbl;`

2. `SELECT volcanoes_tbl.name, volcanoes_tbl.type FROM volcanoes_tbl;`

And so on. Redo queries 3-6 in this format.
